- Always run tests before suggesting code changes: npm run ci in apps/web, pytest in apps/api.
- Keep secrets out of code; use Render env vars from render.yaml.
- For Auth0, follow SETUP in README exactly. Do not modify SDK wiring.
- Prefer minimal changes; do not add new services. Keep PDF with ReportLab only.
